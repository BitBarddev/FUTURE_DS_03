# FUTURE_DS_03

📊 Student Feedback Analysis Dashboard – Python & NLP (Natural Language Programming)

Task 3 – Data Science & Analytics Internship @ Future Interns
This end-to-end Python project was built as part of Task 3 in the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Internship. It focuses on analyzing student satisfaction data from campus events using both structured ratings and open-ended feedback.
The goal: turn student voices into data-backed insights to improve event quality and engagement.

🧠 Project Overview
The project aims to analyze and visualize feedback from workshops, tech fests, and cultural activities submitted via Google Forms.
Using both Likert-scale ratings (1–5) and free-text comments, the notebook helps organizers:
• Understand satisfaction levels across key event aspects
• Identify high and low-performing areas
• Analyze sentiment behind student suggestions
• Recommend improvements for future events

📄 Analysis Components
📌 Ratings Analysis
• Cleaned Google Forms survey data using pandas
• Calculated weighted average ratings per question
• Visualized using:
  ৹ Horizontal bar charts (per-question satisfaction)
  ৹ Pie charts (rating distributions)
  ৹ Stacked bar charts (ratings by question)
  ৹ Heatmaps (cross-comparison of rating levels)

📌 Sentiment Analysis (Text Feedback)
• Used VADER sentiment analyzer to score each comment
• Classified as Positive, Neutral, or Negative
• Generated sentiment distribution plots
• Created word clouds to highlight common themes in feedback

📌 Course-Level Analysis
• Compared average ratings across departments/programs
• Visualized number of responses per course
• Identified specific course trends in satisfaction

🛠️ Tools Used
• Google Colab – No installation required
• pandas – Data manipulation
• seaborn/matplotlib – Visualizations
• VADER Sentiment – NLP sentiment analysis
• WordCloud – Text visualization

💡 Key Learnings
• How to blend structured and unstructured data into one analysis pipeline
• Importance of handling text cleaning for reliable NLP
• Using sentiment scoring to unlock hidden insights from free-text suggestions
• Designing visual narratives that inform real decisions (not just charts)

📈 Project Value
This analysis helps event organizers:
• Identify what students appreciate most in college events
• Uncover common pain points and areas for improvement
• Track how different courses perceive event quality
• Use real data to iterate and design better experiences
